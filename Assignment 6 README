Assignment 6

Problem 1: An adjacency list is used for nodes to know what's next to it, then a BFS is used to explore nodes, beginning with the source. Nodes are tracked as they are visited, and once
the destination is reached True gets returned, with False otherwise if it doesn't
Time complexity is about O(n + e), for the vertices and edges given and visited once each.
