Assignment 3

Problem 1: So taking in an inputted array, then converting it to a binary search tree. Since the list is already sorted, I can just split it down the middle and assign the left and right sides in the tree then recursively assign elements to left and right.
I had a lot of problems making the actual sorting and ordering of the output work, I guess something in the tree was being placed wrongly? I looked up what could be going wrong and at some point I got it to work, but honestly I have no clue what I changed.
Most of the stuff should just be O(n) time complexity, sorting arrays and going through them.
I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-in-python/ to try to figure out how to implement binary search trees along with class slides.

Problem 2:
