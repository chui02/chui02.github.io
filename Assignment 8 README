Assignment 8
Problem 1: An adjacency list is used to represent which courses depending on which prereq is needed.
A degree array is used to track how many prerequisites each course has. Courses with degree == 0 are ready to be taken.
BFS is used to repeatedly take courses from the queue, reduce the in-degree of dependent courses, and add new ones that can be taken to the queue. If the length of the resulting order is less than numCourses, a cycle exists, then returns an empty list.
Time complexity is about O(V + E), for given V being the number of courses and E for the amount of prerequisites.

Problem 2: So given two integers, being a dividend and a divisor
It's checked if the result will be positive or negative since both dividend and divisor are converted to positive w/ absolute values for the purpose of calculating.
After that, dividing is emulated by subtracting the divisor from the dividend as many times as possible before the value left over is less than the divisor, i.e. 8/2 = 4, so we can subtract 4 from 8, 2 times
Bit shifting is used instead though to speed up the actual process as going through subtraction one by one takes too long.
So instead, divisor << i means multiplying divisor by 2^i
Time complexity is about O(log N) for N being a dividend since it doubles the divisor each time w/ shifts.

Problem 3:
Starting with dp[i], this represnets the minimum amount of coins that are needed to make the given amount i.
A dp array is made with the size amount + 1  to account for the worst case being infinity, dp[0] = 0 is set as such for coins needed to make the amount 0
Then for each given coin in coins, we can iterate each coin to the amount while updating dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x - coin] + 1).
That way if dp[amount] is still amount + 1, return -1 (unreachable). Otherwise, returns dp[amount].
Time complexity is about O(given amount * len(amount of coins)).

Problem 4: A lot of the design features come from already existing popular media such as Twitter (or X but nobody calls it that), Facebook, Instagram, ect.
The basic outline contains:
User model: A way to track followers, who you're following, posts, and messages.
Post model: A likes system (to get trending and popular posts), timestamps, replies, mentions, and privacy options.
Privacy: Hiding certain information/posts when generating the feed such as if an account only wants to post to followers, ect.
Trending: Posts are considered trending upon reaching a certain threshold (could be a number of likes, how quickly it gets likes, ect) sorted by likes in order.
Mentions: User mentions using the @ symbol are extracted and stored (not fully used here but useful for tagging systems).
Direct messaging: A simple inbox with messages for personal communication.
Threading: Replies to a post are grouped for ease of use.

In order, time complexity ranges about:
Following for user: O(1)
Posting content: O(F) if pushing it out, O(1) if pulling it in
Creating a user's feed: O(F log k)
Liking and tagging/mentioning: O(1) or O(L) depending on action
Getting trending posts: O(log k)
Messaging between users: O(1) for sending, O(M) for reading

In the .py file for this problem I kinda just went with trying to implement basic function as an example, but it's very barebones by itself.
